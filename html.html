HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <section></section>
It is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.<section></section>
The term "Hypertext" defines the link between the web pages and markup language.<div> <span></span></div>
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<div> <span></span></div>
It describes the structure of a web page.<div> <span></span></div>
It consists of a series of elements. These elements tell the browser how to display the content.<div> <span></span></div>
These elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.<div> <span></span></div>


<h5> Uses</h5>
HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www).
It contains "Tags" and "Attributes" that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.

  <h4><center>Html Semantics</center></h4>
Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. 
It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.<div> <span></span></div>
Html Semantics clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of semantic elements: 'form', 'table', and 'article' - Clearly defines its content. <div> <span></span></div>
Examples of non-semantic elements: 'div' and 'span" - Tells nothing about its content.<div> <span></span></div>
Other examples of Html Semantics include: 'article', 'footer', 'header', etc.

    <h5><center>HTML Tags</center></h5>
 Tags are simple pieces of data — usually no more than one to three words — that describe information on a document, web page, or another digital file. 
 Tags provide details about an item and make it easy to locate related items that have the same tag.<div> <span></span></div>
 
 
 <h4><center><i>Container Tags</i></Center></h4>
    Container tags are generally divided into three parts, i.e., opening tag, content(which will display on the browser), and closing tag.
In the content part, they can also contain some other tags.

Some commonly used container tags are:

<h6>Essential Tags</h6>:
<'html'>: This marks the beginning and ending of the webpage also it tells that the document is an HTML document. <div> <span></span></div>
<'head'>: This tag is used to define the head part of the document which contains the information related to the webpage.<div> <span></span></div>
<'title'>: This tag stores the description of the web page, whatever given in these tags appears on the tab name while opened by the browser.<div> <span></span></div>

<h6>Headings</h6> 
(h1>/h1> to h6>/h6): It is used for including headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6.
