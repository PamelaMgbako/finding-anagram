Florence Nightingale born on the 12th day of May 1820 was an English social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern nursing. 
Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses durin+g the Crimean War,in which she organised care for wounded soldiers 
at Constantinople. She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture,
especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.
In 1860, she laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. 
It was the first secular nursing school in the world, and is now part of King's College London.
In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, 
the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday. 
Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, 
helping to abolish prostitution laws that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce.
